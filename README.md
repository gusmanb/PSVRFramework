# PSVR Framework

# NOTICE: Discontinued

This project has been discontinued as PSVR is now obsolete and makes no sense to continue its development. Project has been archived.

---

This is my little framework for the PS VR made from a recopilation of info I found over Internet and my own findings.

This framework allows you to control the PS VR set states, turn it on/off, enter/exit VR mode, recenter theater, control box power and read the headset sensors.

This is an experimental work, expect fails ;)

I promise I will add all the required licenses ;)

You need the .net Framework 4.5.2 or newer installed to make it work and also need to follow the instructions on the HowTo.txt file on this repository.
